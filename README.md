# Screen Time Awareness Tool

An Android application designed to help students and young adults build healthier screen habits by tracking app usage and offering real-time, opt-in interventions.  

## Project Vision
For students and young adults  
Who struggle with excessive or unconscious screen time  
The Screen Time Awareness Tool is an Android app  
That tracks per-app usage and offers real-time, opt-in interventions to exit distracting apps, start a focus timer, and capture quick reflections.  
Unlike phone-native settings buried in menus, our app puts awareness and self-control front and center.
